Introduction
------------
This is the source of a simple webpage tool that allows you to easily generate balanced Overwatch teams.

Features
--------
### Role balancing
The algorithm not only takes player ranks into consideration but also roles. When adding players you can choose what role you want them to fill. The algorithm prioritizes these roles over rank in order to maintain a healthy balance of roles. But fear not, the average ranks will still be as close to each other as possible!

### Easily add up to 24 players
Simply add players by filling in a name, rank and role on the menu to the right. You can also input a list of players by using the **Quick Add** button at the top right. The tool supports up to 24 players, meaning this is a perfect tool when you are playing pick-up games with more than 12 players!
